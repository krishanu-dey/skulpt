Sounds
------

There is a distinction between a ``Sound``, which contains all the data
to describe a sound, and a ``SoundPerformance``, which represents one
occasion of playing some sound. These map fairly closely to the Web
Audio concepts of ``AudioBuffer`` and ``AudioBufferSource``
respectively.

There is a Skulpt/Pytch-global ``sound_manager`` object. It provides
methods:

-  ``async_load_sound(name, url)`` — return (a Promise resolving to) a
   ``Sound`` object

-  ``stop_all_performances()`` — cancel all running
   ``SoundPerformance``\ s

-  ``one_frame()`` — do whatever housekeeping is required internally for
   the sound-manager

The environment (test or browser) is responsible for calling
``one_frame()``; we don’t do this in the ``Project``, to separate these
concerns, and in case we ever have multiple concurrent projects.

``Sound`` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Created by the sound-manager’s ``async_load_sound()`` method. Has the
single method

-  ``launch_new_performance()`` — create and start playing a new
   performance of this sound

and the property

-  ``tag`` — a short human-useful string for diagnostic purposes

``SoundPerformance`` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Created by the ``launch_new_performance()`` method of a ``Sound``. Has
the properties

-  ``tag`` — diagnostic tag for human consumption; the ``name`` of the
   ``Sound`` of which this is a performance

-  ``has_ended`` — indicates whether the performance has ended or not
   (if not, the performance is still going)

and the single method

-  ``stop()`` — interrupt the performance, stopping any noise, and
   marking the performance as having ended

It is not an error to call ``stop()`` on an already-ended performance.

Registration of sounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An actor (sprite or stage) Python class should have a class-level
attribute ``Sounds`` which is a list of 2-element tuples (*name*,
*url*). The *url* should point to a sound file of supported format. The
*name* is used in Actor methods to be described next.

Actor methods for playing sounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An actor has the sound-related methods

-  ``self.start_sound(name)`` — launch a new performance of the given
   sound, and continue execution of the current thread immediately

-  ``self.play_sound_until_done(name)`` — launch a new performance of
   the given sound, and pause the calling thread’s execution until the
   sound has finished playing

Implemented via a syscall which uses the global sound-manager. The
‘until done’ variant puts the thread to sleep; the has_ended property is
polled to know when to wake it.

Sound manager separate one-frame() call; serves pretty different
purposes in test and real; not fully convinced this is a clean design;
could have instead had the project’s one-frame() call the
sound-manager’s but kept separate in case ever have more than one
project.

Real browser-based sound-manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sound is async-loaded by decoding from array-buffer, and creating Sound
from it. Sound can create buffer-source, which is wrapped in
sound-performance.

Small wrinkle because can’t create running audio-context without user
gesture, so have to defer creating sound-manager (with its
audio-context) until first ‘BUILD’ click.

Red-flag stops all sounds, which means we need to track all running
performances. Add them to list when launched. One-frame culls all
completed performances from that list.

Testing / mock sound-manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knows how many frames to wait before declaring a performance ‘done’. The
one_frame() method allows the sound-manager to count elapsed frames.
