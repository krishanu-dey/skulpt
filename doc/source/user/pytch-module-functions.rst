Functions in the pytch module
=============================

TODO: Check and update the below list.

* ``pytch.wait_seconds(n_seconds)`` makes the script calling
  ``wait_seconds()`` do nothing for ``n_seconds`` seconds before
  resuming; currently this is done by counting frames, so complicated
  scripts which render at less than 60fps will wait for the wrong
  amount of time; fixing this is on the roadmap
* ``pytch.broadcast(message_string)`` broadcasts the message
  ``message_string``, launching any scripts with a matching
  ``@pytch.when_I_receive()`` decorator (hat-block); the script calling
  ``broadcast()`` continues, with the responses happening concurrently
* ``pytch.broadcast_and_wait(message_string)`` broadcasts the message
  ``message_string``, launching any scripts with a matching
  ``@pytch.when_I_receive()`` decorator (hat-block); the script
  calling ``broadcast_and_wait()`` waits until all those scripts have
  finished before continuing
* ``pytch.key_pressed(key_name)`` gives a true/false answer as to
  whether the key with name ``key_name`` is currently pressed


Variable watchers
-----------------

.. note::
   This is an experimental part of Pytch.  In future versions of
   Pytch, we might change the way variable watchers work, depending on
   user feedback.

In Scratch, you can "show" a variable, either by ticking a box in the
UI, or by using the *show variable MY-VARIABLE* block.  Pytch does not
have a box to tick, but does have the ``pytch.show_variable()``
function.  The simplest way to show a variable is to use
``pytch.show_variable()`` like this:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   @pytch.when_I_receive("set-up-score")
   def set_up_score(self):
       self.score = 0
       pytch.show_variable(self, "score")

As this example shows, you give Pytch two pieces of information: you
tell it who owns the variable you want to show (here, the ``self``
sprite), and you tell it the **name** of the variable, as a string
(here, ``"score"``).  In this simple form, the Stage will show a small
'watcher' box with a *label* and the variable's *value*.  By default,
the label is the same as the variable name, and the watcher appears in
the top-left corner of the stage.

You can tell Pytch where to show the watcher by giving it more
information.  You can choose whether to fix the *left* or *right* edge
of the box, by giving the stage *x*-coordinate where you want that
edge to be.  You can separately choose whether to fix the *top* or
*bottom* edge, by giving a stage *y*-coordinate.  You can tell also
Pytch what label to use, instead of the variable name.

To pass any of these arguments, use Python's *named argument* syntax.
In this example, we pass ``label``, ``top``, and ``right`` as named
arguments:

.. code-block:: python

   pytch.show_variable(self, "score", label="SCORE:", top=176, right=236)

This will set up a watcher for ``self.score``, showing the value with
the label ``SCORE:``, a little way in from the top-right corner of the
stage.


Sprite variables and clones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Scratch, you can only show the original instance's value of a "for
this Sprite only" variable.  In Pytch, you can show a clone's value of
the variable.  When a clone is running a method, ``self`` refers to
that clone.

When a clone is deleted, any variable watchers showing variables
belonging to that clone are removed.


Project-level variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you will have a variable at the top level of your project, outside any
Sprite or Stage.  These are also called "global" variables.  As a
special case, to show these variables, you can use ``None`` as the
first argument to ``show_variable()``, for example:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 7

   score = 100

   class Ship(pytch.Sprite):
       # [...]
       @pytch.when_this_sprite_clicked
       def show_score(self):
           pytch.show_variable(None, "score")



Advanced usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Pytch programs will not need to use the techniques in this
section.

In fact any attribute will do, so you can for example give the name of
a *property* to compute the value dynamically.  This property will be
accessed 60 times a second so should not do any heavy computation.

So far we have given examples where the "variable owner", i.e., the
first argument to ``pytch.show_variable()``, is a Sprite, or your
Stage, or ``None`` to mean a global variable.  It can also be any
other object in your program, for instance a non-Actor class:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2,8

   class GameState:
       score = 100

   class Ship(pytch.Sprite):
       # [...]
       @pytch.when_this_sprite_clicked
       def show_score(self):
           pytch.show_variable(GameState, "score")
