Scratch blocks â†’ Pytch functions and methods
============================================

Apart from the :doc:`hat blocks<hat-blocks>`, which have :doc:`their
own help page<hat-blocks>`, Pytch provides equivalents to (some)
Scratch blocks in three ways:


Methods on a Sprite
-------------------

Some Scratch blocks affect just the particular sprite they run on.
For example, the *switch costume* block.  For blocks like this, Pytch
uses *methods* of the Sprite class.  These are discussed in
:doc:`their own help page<sprite>`.


Methods on the Stage
--------------------

Some Scratch blocks are special to the Stage.  For these blocks, Pytch
uses *methods* of the Stage class.  These are discussed in :doc:`their own
help page<stage>`.


Functions in the pytch module
-----------------------------

Some Scratch blocks affect the whole project, for example *wait for 3
seconds*.  For these blocks, Pytch uses *functions* in the ``pytch``
module.  These are discussed in :doc:`their own help page<pytch-module-functions>`.
